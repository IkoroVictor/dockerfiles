## Google Chrome with nvidia 361 driver support

This setup is largely based on jfrazelle's work [https://github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles) but specific to the nightmare that is the nvidia driver.

The way this works is that container nvidia driver has to match the host operating system (in my case, I'm running this on the 361 beta drivers).

Your mileage will greatly vary.
